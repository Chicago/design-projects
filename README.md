# design-projects
A public kanban repository maintained by the Design Office to track (mostly) public design work.
Other project work &amp; one-off tasks are tracked elsewhere. They do not appear in Github.

Feel free to request work or comment on current work by [filing an issue in Github](https://github.com/Chicago/design-projects/issues). Assign it to [me](https://github.com/jdkunesh) and away we'll go.
