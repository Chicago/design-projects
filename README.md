# design-projects
A public repository maintained by the Design Office to track new &amp; current public or mostly public design work.
Other project work managed elsewhere and one-off tasks are tracked elsewhere and do not appear on Github.

Feel free to request work or comment on current work by [filing an issue in Github](https://github.com/Chicago/design-projects/issues). Assign it to [me](https://github.com/jdkunesh) and away we'll go. 

[Review our work status KanBan board](https://github.com/Chicago/design-projects/projects/1).
